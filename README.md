`smash-pvp-base` is a [FiveM](https://fivem.net) resource group developed for a pvp server. 

## Release reason
These scripts were developed for my pvp server. Due to several reasons I will not open it anymore, therefore, the scripts will be released for other developers to be **inspired / studied**, the way they prefer.

These scripts do not work simply because when running Control C and Control V, you have to study the code and adapt your base.

## Support
The developers do not provide installation support, if you have any questions about the code itself contact us at Discord.
> pk#5460 **or** Gustavovk#0606
